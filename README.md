# Eco-Connect Recycle and Recover

This project aims to bridge the gap between consumers looking to dispose of recyclable materials and rag pickers seeking to collect them. It provides a platform where consumers can post details about the recyclable materials they have, and rag pickers can accept these requests. The platform also allows users to find rag pickers or post requests for rag collection.

## Features

- **For Consumers**: Allows consumers to post details about recyclable materials they want to dispose of.

- **For Rag Pickers**: Enables rag pickers to find available rag collection requests posted by consumers.

- **Support**: Offers a support page for users to get help with their queries or issues.

- **Find Requests**: Allows users to find and view all the rag collection requests posted on the platform.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React**: Used for building the user interface.

- **Material-UI**: Utilized for designing the UI components and layouts.

- **React Router**: Manages navigation between different parts of the application.

- **Java Spring Boot**: Provides the backend framework for creating RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.

- **MySQL**: Used as the relational database management system to store and manage application data.
